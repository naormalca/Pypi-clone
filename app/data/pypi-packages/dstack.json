You can change it by including `--profile <PROFILE NAME>` in your command. This allows you to configure multiple profiles and refer to them from your code by their names.\n\nBy default, the configuration profile is stored locally, i.e. in your working directory: `<WORKING_DIRECTORY>/.dstack/config.yaml`\n\nSee [CLI Reference](https://docs.dstack.ai/cli-reference) to more information about command line tools or type `dstack config --help`.\n\n## Publishing simple plots\n\nOnce the **dstack profile** is configured, you can publish plots from your Python program or Jupyter notebook. Let's consider the simpliest example, line plot using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library, but you can use [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) and [plotly](https://plot.ly) plots instead of matplotlib in the same way: \n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom dstack import push_frame\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 9, 16])\n\npush_frame(\"simple\", fig, \"My first plot\")\n```\n\n## Publishing interactive plots\n\nIn some cases, you want to have plots that are interactive and that can change when the user change its parameters. Suppose you want to publish a line plot that depends on the value of the parameter `Coefficient` (slope).\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom dstack import create_frame\n\ndef line_plot(a):\n    xs = range(0, 21)\n    ys = [a * x for x in xs]\n    fig = plt.figure()\n    plt.axis([0, 20, 0, 20])\n    plt.plot(xs, ys)\n    return fig\n\n\nframe = create_frame(\"line_plot\")\ncoeff = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n\nfor c in coeff:\n    frame.commit(line_plot(c), f\"Line plot with the coefficient of {c}\", {\"Coefficient\": c})\n\nframe.push()\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more details on the API and code samples, check out the [docs](https://docs.dstack.ai).","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"home_page":"https://dstack.ai","keywords":"","license":"LICENSE","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"dstack","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/dstack/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/dstack/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://dstack.ai"},"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/dstack/0.1.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"An open-source library to publish plots","version":"0.1.0"},"last_serial":6710880,"releases":{"0.1.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"7fd404a5b90823727f349d638d7aad33","sha256":"cca1869981f5ad84ce18249b4785b428eef892fc3c98aa3424fbcdeb1495191b"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"dstack-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7fd404a5b90823727f349d638d7aad33","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":12193,"upload_time":"2020-02-27T13:02:46","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-02-27T13:02:46.771586Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/61/fe/4452a4febeb0d01808ab2e807f694578608938aa987267afaea87bbe5ae2/dstack-0.1.0.tar.gz"}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"7fd404a5b90823727f349d638d7aad33","sha256":"cca1869981f5ad84ce18249b4785b428eef892fc3c98aa3424fbcdeb1495191b"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"dstack-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7fd404a5b90823727f349d638d7aad33","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":12193,"upload_time":"2020-02-27T13:02:46","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-02-27T13:02:46.771586Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/61/fe/4452a4febeb0d01808ab2e807f694578608938aa987267afaea87bbe5ae2/dstack-0.1.0.tar.gz"}]}

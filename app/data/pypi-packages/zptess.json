An estimator of central tendency of frequencies is taken on each buffer (default estimator: median). The standard deviation from this estimator is also computed to asses the quality of readings. If this standard deviation is zero on either buffer, the whole process is discarded. Otherwise, we keep the estimated central tendency of reference and test frequencies and compute a candidate Zero Point.\n\nThis process is repeated in a series of rounds (default: 5 rounds) and we select the \"best\" estimation of frequencies and Zero Point. The best freequency estimation is chosen as the *mode* with a fallback to *median* if mode does not exists.\n\n#### Formulae\n```\nMag[ref] = ZP[fict] - 2.5*log10(Freq[ref])\nMag[tst] = ZP[fict] - 2.5*log10(Freq[tst])\nOffset   = 2.5*log10(Freq[tst]/Freq[ref])\n\nZP[calibrated] = ZP[ref] + Offset\n\nwhere \n\tZP[fict] is a ficticios zero point of 20.50 to compare readings with the TESS Windows utility \n\t         by Cristobal Garc\u00eda.\n\tZP[ref] is the absolute Zero Point of the calibrated TESS-W (20.44) determined by LICA.\n```","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"home_page":"http://github.com/astrorafael/tessdb/","keywords":"Astronomy Python RaspberryPi","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"zptess","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zptess/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zptess/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"http://github.com/astrorafael/tessdb/"},"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zptess/2.0.2/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"('Utility to calibrate TESS-W, TESS-P & TAS photometers',)","version":"2.0.2"},"last_serial":6710148,"releases":{"2.0.2":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"5e15d3681fd0b9915a0c9174b2377f20","sha256":"6982810ac982fc10aa190898dea3b3c32f4b42483ca28a749241cb12113fcdba"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"zptess-2.0.2.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5e15d3681fd0b9915a0c9174b2377f20","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":33871,"upload_time":"2020-02-27T10:17:39","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-02-27T10:17:39.050005Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/67/bb/c74f24c604f1f9e97826e96b7a14425be553c4ad4aab31309dbb5d0117a5/zptess-2.0.2.tar.gz"}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"5e15d3681fd0b9915a0c9174b2377f20","sha256":"6982810ac982fc10aa190898dea3b3c32f4b42483ca28a749241cb12113fcdba"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"zptess-2.0.2.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5e15d3681fd0b9915a0c9174b2377f20","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":33871,"upload_time":"2020-02-27T10:17:39","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-02-27T10:17:39.050005Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/67/bb/c74f24c604f1f9e97826e96b7a14425be553c4ad4aab31309dbb5d0117a5/zptess-2.0.2.tar.gz"}]}

This\nJSON file is a list of all the individual JSON files from ``next-release``.\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\n$ pip install semversioner\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Bumping the version\n\nIn your local environment your will use the CLI to create the different changeset files that will be committed with your code. For example:\n```shell\n$ semversioner add-change --type patch --description \"Fix security vulnerability with authentication.\"\n```\n\nThen, in your CI/CD tool you will need to release (generating automatically version number) and creating the the changelog file. \n```shell\n$ semversioner release\n```\n\n### Generating Changelog\n\nAs a part of your CI/CD workflow, you will be able to generate the Changelog file with all changes.\n\n```shell\n$ semversioner changelog > CHANGELOG.md\n```\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2020 Raul Gomis.\nMIT licensed, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n\n---\nMade with \u2665 by `Raul Gomis <https://twitter.com/rgomis>`.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"home_page":"https://bitbucket.org/bitbucketpipelines/semversioner/","keywords":"","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"semversioner2","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/semversioner2/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/semversioner2/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/bitbucketpipelines/semversioner/"},"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/semversioner2/0.8.4/","requires_dist":["click","jinja2"],"requires_python":">=3.1.0","summary":"Manage properly semver in your repository","version":"0.8.4"},"last_serial":6811808,"releases":{"0.8.4":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"1050a31a4cb51487f6ab19198fee7800","sha256":"05f65f26162e4c4cf5302f99f8cb60abc6aba310464f59a6c5db57d9922284ac"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"semversioner2-0.8.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"1050a31a4cb51487f6ab19198fee7800","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":">=3.1.0","size":6372,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:36:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:36:25.971053Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b0/d0/793087185ca3f9622129cc4f2a73a51517f3df2d18406ba9d02118eabad5/semversioner2-0.8.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl"},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"2b895990434ef6a4db52d1b3f46437c0","sha256":"69faec9acc7832ec909d01482c29f296ac35d004de66e1a7d2dc82fb49fb45b7"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"semversioner2-0.8.4.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"2b895990434ef6a4db52d1b3f46437c0","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.1.0","size":6424,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:36:27","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:36:27.946781Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7a/8a/a38a7222b26fb34474d22b9159e087a797fce5264f6c84aa1f1a98492e39/semversioner2-0.8.4.tar.gz"}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"1050a31a4cb51487f6ab19198fee7800","sha256":"05f65f26162e4c4cf5302f99f8cb60abc6aba310464f59a6c5db57d9922284ac"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"semversioner2-0.8.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"1050a31a4cb51487f6ab19198fee7800","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":">=3.1.0","size":6372,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:36:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:36:25.971053Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b0/d0/793087185ca3f9622129cc4f2a73a51517f3df2d18406ba9d02118eabad5/semversioner2-0.8.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl"},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"2b895990434ef6a4db52d1b3f46437c0","sha256":"69faec9acc7832ec909d01482c29f296ac35d004de66e1a7d2dc82fb49fb45b7"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"semversioner2-0.8.4.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"2b895990434ef6a4db52d1b3f46437c0","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.1.0","size":6424,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:36:27","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:36:27.946781Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7a/8a/a38a7222b26fb34474d22b9159e087a797fce5264f6c84aa1f1a98492e39/semversioner2-0.8.4.tar.gz"}]}

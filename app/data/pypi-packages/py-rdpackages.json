This should be fixed in future versions.\n2. I have not written a full set of graphics options for the RD plots. Future versions will allow you to use all of the classic `matplotlib` tools, and also turn on/off the vertical line and change the coloring of the scatterplot. Also, I do not incorporate standard errors on the scatterplot bins, which would be easy enough to add. In this version, if you want to do some of those things, you should do them after making a function call.\n3. Of course, Python calling R and then converting back to python is not ideal. Some future version should get the original C implementation of the code and just work from there.\n\nHopefully I will make these better in the future, but for now let me know if you spot any bugs.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"home_page":"https://github.com/lucashusted/py_rdpackages","keywords":"","license":"GNU","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"py-rdpackages","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/py-rdpackages/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/py-rdpackages/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/lucashusted/py_rdpackages"},"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/py-rdpackages/0.0.1/","requires_dist":["matplotlib","seaborn","rpy2","numpy","pandas (>=0.25)","statsmodels"],"requires_python":">=3","summary":"A Pythonic Package for Regression Discontinuity","version":"0.0.1"},"last_serial":6811850,"releases":{"0.0.1":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"2a13cabb08a4a4e610f267fd4e8f0430","sha256":"6e1f9616f8a64ceb39dbb669184945d96a97b2f1b9aa5b2e3f61b81464cd9863"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"py_rdpackages-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"2a13cabb08a4a4e610f267fd4e8f0430","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3","size":21430,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:48:17","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:48:17.571517Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8e/59/0888110faa28f06a37f60e0fb8ebc9c34e5550aa5806f8acbe249d6f1e56/py_rdpackages-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"e9584976e4d20bfadd5f21334f62aa8a","sha256":"5376c6cc31e07871b56ba02b1bd2feeaa5244f5fee89e04960369fbc75e7f7ae"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"py_rdpackages-0.0.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"e9584976e4d20bfadd5f21334f62aa8a","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3","size":10028,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:48:20","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:48:20.178003Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/69/d2/fc7cb3fff1623edec26f65578640b0d4e3d3a51f1b5096c132d5782b3db5/py_rdpackages-0.0.1.tar.gz"}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"2a13cabb08a4a4e610f267fd4e8f0430","sha256":"6e1f9616f8a64ceb39dbb669184945d96a97b2f1b9aa5b2e3f61b81464cd9863"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"py_rdpackages-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"2a13cabb08a4a4e610f267fd4e8f0430","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3","size":21430,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:48:17","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:48:17.571517Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8e/59/0888110faa28f06a37f60e0fb8ebc9c34e5550aa5806f8acbe249d6f1e56/py_rdpackages-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"md5":"e9584976e4d20bfadd5f21334f62aa8a","sha256":"5376c6cc31e07871b56ba02b1bd2feeaa5244f5fee89e04960369fbc75e7f7ae"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"py_rdpackages-0.0.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"e9584976e4d20bfadd5f21334f62aa8a","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3","size":10028,"upload_time":"2020-03-14T15:48:20","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-03-14T15:48:20.178003Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/69/d2/fc7cb3fff1623edec26f65578640b0d4e3d3a51f1b5096c132d5782b3db5/py_rdpackages-0.0.1.tar.gz"}]}
